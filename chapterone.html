                <h2>Summary</h2>

                <p>Chapter One is a quirky independently owned coffee and book shop found on Lever Street, only a short walk from Piccadilly gardens. Serving some of the best locally roasted coffee in Northern Quarter, Chapter One is a great place to come and chill out, read or even get on with some work. They also offer free fast Wi-Fi for customers. A good range of books are also on display around the shop which customers are free to pick up and read. As well as the great coffee they serve a range of other drinks hot and cold from traditional rose lemonade too matcha tea. Also on offer is a wide variety of delicious cakes, brownies and other baked goods.

                <br>

                <p> The interior of the shop itself is very quaint and definitely encapsulates the trendy Northern Quarter aesthetic. The furniture is very traditional and doll-esque and the space and choices of places to sit are wide as the main areas of the shop go back several rooms. There is also a higher up seating area above the main room with stairs that gives the shop more depth and variety. The staff are very friendly and the community feel among them and the regular customers is a comforting and inviting experience. Bookings can be made also where an area or a set of tables can be reserved if you and a group of friends are wanting a place to meet. The shop is also open to events that can be booked and an area of the shop will be reserved for you as well. All in all Chapter One is a great coffee shop to try out and see if the vibe is something you like.</p>
