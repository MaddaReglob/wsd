                <h2>Summary</h2>

                <p> The Koffee pot has been a go to for many manchunicans for over a decade, since its opening in 2007, with fantastic vegan options, super fast service and super friendly waiting staff, the Koffee pot if great for both its coffee and food alike.. The koffee pot offers free WiFi, Vegan options, super fast food service and friendly waiting staff. Basically everything you come to expect from the northern quarter. If it's the vibe you are after, then look no further. Inside, it has the feel of an old-style Northern Quarter Bar with upcoming local gig posters on the wall. It really does remind me of what you would expect to find in the northern quarter On arrival, the friendly staff greeted me with warmth. The service was quick, with my order was taken within a few minutes and my food arriving soon after ordering. Not only was the food great, the coffee I ordered was even better. It was reasonably priced and tasted fantastic, just as i expect from coffee shops such as starbucks and other international brands. After finishing my meal I was able to stay around which allowed me to take advantage of their free wifi and their fantastic coffee which is great for me, a student at university, considering I had many deadlines approaching and as a bonus the atmosphere inside the koffee pot made the work seem a lot less daunting and it allowed me to concentrate more on the work, which is hard to say for most places in the area. Overall, I know for a fact I will be returning in the future as the full breakfast and complimentary coffee or tea for Â£7 is a no brainer.</p>
