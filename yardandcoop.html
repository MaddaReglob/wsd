                <h2>Summary</h2>

                <p>There are 3 steps to choosing from the menu, choose your type of chicken, the sauce/marinade you want on it and then a style of fries instead of the regular option.
                    As well as chicken and chips they offer a tasty range of classic sides from mac and cheese too salads and onion rings too coleslaw. 
                    Although being a mainly meat eater restaurant there is a choice of vegetarian options on the menu. 
                    From not chicken nuggets made out of halloumi and many of the regular options being vegetarian friendly already there is plenty to choose from if you don’t eat meat.
                    <br>
                   <br>
                       The interior of the restaurant is a mix between wood and metal for the tables, chairs and a stock room style caged off area near the entrance which gives the restaurant an industrial feel. There are also big wide windows that let in light making the main eating areas feel spacious and airy. The staff are very friendly and well informed on the menu making a visit to Yard and Coop a friendly and enjoyable experience. 
                       The only downsides that can be outlined is that on some of the busiest weekend days you sometimes have to wait to get a table and the wait times for food can be a little longer than usual but can only be expected with great tasting food! 
                       Yard and Coop also have many special events that go on throughout the year where they in fact give out free chicken! This event ‘The Big Choock Off’ entailed giving away 1000 portions of chicken and chips to those in a first come first served basis. This was all done in the name of charity too with a collection for Mustard Tree Manchester with the restaurant doubling the money raised by diners on the day. 
                       Yard and Coop is definitely a place to try out if friend chicken is your thing!
